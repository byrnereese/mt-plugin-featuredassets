# Overview

This plugin provides a rudimentary ability to flag assets
within Movable Type as "featured." This can be used to a 
variety of effects, but was designed for hand selecting 
images to appear in a slideshow.

The plugin as a new column to the asset listing table that
discloses an assets featured state. It also utilizes an 
intuitive AJAX interface for toggling an asset's featured 
state. 

# Status

This plugin should in theory work. However, there is a bug
in Movable Type that prevents the MT::Asset class from being
extended by plugins. Until that bug is fixed this plugin
will not work. Sorry folks.
